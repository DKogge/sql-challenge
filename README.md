Module 9

Used QuickDBD to create the relationship diagram and added the primary keys and relationships.  dept_emp is a composite key with both columns being designated as primary and foreign keys. 

Was able to import the data from the CSV files into the tables via pgAdmin4, screenshots included of each table.

Will continue to work on the data analysis as time permits.  More to come!
